# Next.js MongoDB Application

This is a simple application built with Next.js and MongoDB for managing a collection of entities. The application allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on entities, which are stored in a MongoDB database using Mongoose as the ORM.

## Features

- **Entity Management**: Add, edit, delete, and list entities.
- **Dynamic Data Fetching**: Fetch and store external data (e.g., weather forecasts, currency exchange rates) for further use.
- **Sorting and Searching**: Easily sort and search through the list of entities.
- **Pagination**: Navigate through large sets of entities with pagination support.
- **Unique Identifier**: Each entity has a unique identifier for easy access and management.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-side rendered applications.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing entity data.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- MongoDB (local or cloud instance)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nextjs-mongo-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd nextjs-mongo-app
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up your environment variables in the `.env.local` file. You will need to add your MongoDB connection string:

   ```
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   ```

### Running the Application

To start the development server, run:

```
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### API Endpoints

- `GET /api/entities`: List all entities.
- `POST /api/entities`: Add a new entity.
- `PUT /api/entities/:id`: Edit an existing entity.
- `DELETE /api/entities/:id`: Delete an entity.

### Additional Features

Feel free to explore and add more features to enhance the application. Some ideas include:

- User authentication to manage access to the entity management features.
- Enhanced UI/UX with better styling and user feedback.
- Integration with additional external data sources.
